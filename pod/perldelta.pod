=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.39.9

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.39.8 release and the 5.39.9
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.39.7, first read
L<perl5398delta>, which describes differences between 5.39.7 and 5.39.8.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 New C<^^> logical xor operator

Perl has always had three low-precedence logical operators C<and>, C<or> and
C<xor>, as well as three high-precedence bitwise versions C<&>, C<^> and C<|>.
Until this release, while the medium-precedence logical operators of C<&&> and
C<||> were also present, there was no exclusive-or equivalent.  This release
of Perl adds the final C<^^> operator, completing the set.

    $x ^^ $y and say "One of x or y is true, but not both";

diagnostic messages, see L<perldiag>.

=head2 Changes to Existing Diagnostics

=over 4

=item *

Perl version 5.39.7 added a new warning, "Lexical subroutine %s masks
previously declared package subroutine".  This was later found to be
inconsistent with the behaviour of lexical variables, unhelpful in most common
cases, and caused many unnecessary warnings to be printed across CPAN modules.
This warning has now been removed.

=head1 Acknowledgements

Perl 5.39.9 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl
5.39.8 and contains approximately 15,000 lines of changes across 230 files
from 21 authors.

Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were
approximately 4,400 lines of changes to 140 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.

Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are known to have

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
L<https://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
